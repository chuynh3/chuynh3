# Welcome to my page everyone! ðŸ‘‹

- I'm currently working at consulting company on legal projects regarding Class Action cases and claims. My background in education is in Project management, public relations and freelance writing (ranging from journalism, business communication and technical writing). Before starting to work in legal, I worked in the supply chain industry for 12 years.
- Outside of work and learning, I love travelling around the world, photography and snowboarding. Tech wise, I don't have so much experience other than running some past Agile projects.
- Most of my technologies experiences were limited within logisitics, manufacturing, contract packaging label designing.
